            This quiz is designed for those who are switching to Linux or are new to it. This quiz will help you choose from the 15 most popular Linux distributions. <br/>
            <b>Note:</b> The intention of this quiz is not to prove any distribution to be better than the other. Linux enthusiasts who are disappointed with the results can try the distribution they like. This project just intends to guide Linux newbies to some Linux distro, and not leave them in uncertainty before choosing one.
